# probability
Get next variant for given state and probability expectations

To get it compiled execute:

```
gcc prob.c -o <exec_file_name>
```

then execute it:


```
./<exec_file_name>
```

The program will ask you to give a Prob - it's a number (might be float of course) that represents ration between the cases: in result first_case / second_case = prob

Then program will ask to give a Nums - it's a loop depth to be executed to check how prob() function works.
